# Football Leagues - iOS Swift App

The Football Leagues Swift Application is a clean and scalable, reusable and maintainable iOS app built using the Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator (MVVM-C) architecture. This project is designed to demonstrate best practices for developing iOS applications, including code organization, maintainability, and scalability.

## Features

- ```View a list of football leagues.```
- ```See league details, including name, country, and seasons.```
- ```Surfe specific club details```
- ```Navigate between views using a coordinator pattern.```
- ```Fetch data from a sample API.```
- ```Native Generic Reactive URLSession```
- ```MVVM architecture for clean separation of concerns.```
- ```Dependency injection for testability.```
- ```Swift, UIKit, Xib files.```
- ```Combine for reactive programming.```
- ```Core data for caching```

## Architecture

This project follows the Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator (MVVM-C) architecture pattern for a clean and maintainable codebase. Here's a brief overview of the components:

- **Model**: Represents the data structure of the application.
- **View**: Displays the UI and binds to ViewModels.
- **ViewModel**: Handles business logic and exposes data to the View.
- **Coordinator**: Manages navigation and flow between screens.

The project also employs Clean Architecture principles to separate concerns and promote testability.
